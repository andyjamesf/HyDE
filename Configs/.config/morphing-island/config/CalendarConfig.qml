// Calendar (island mode "calendar"): opened with a click on the clock pill, or on the time in the
// expanded island. A month view, the chosen day's events and your calendars, where new ones are
// added: paste an iCal/webcal link (Google Calendar's "secret address in iCal format", Outlook,
// Nextcloud…) or pick a .ics file.
//
// The list of calendars lives in ~/.local/share/quickshell/calendars.json and the events in
// ~/.cache/quickshell/calendar.json: shared with the HyDE Quickshell shell, outside the dotfiles
// repository (private iCal links give read access to the calendar). Dates and names follow
// Clock.locale. (Named CalendarConfig because services/Calendar.qml is the service.)
